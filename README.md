This project involves developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The Sequential model consists of multiple Dense layers with ReLU activation and a softmax layer for predicting one of the ten digit classes. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss. During training, the model achieved an accuracy of **99.43%** with a loss of **0.0183**, and on the validation set, it reached **98.88%** accuracy with a loss of **0.0617**. 

When tested on unseen data, the model performed with a **test accuracy of 98.46%** and a **loss of 0.0615**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying handwritten digits. These results show that the model is highly accurate and well-suited for image classification tasks, showcasing its reliability in practical applications.
